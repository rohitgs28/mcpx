## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- What you did
- What you expected
- What happened instead
- Your Go version and OS

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. Describe the use case, not just the solution.

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Write your code and tests
4. Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`
5. Commit with a clear message: `feat: add websocket transport support`
6. Push and open a PR against `main`

### Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only
- `test:` adding tests
- `refactor:` code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `chore:` build process or tooling changes

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Every exported function needs a doc comment
- Every new package needs a package-level doc comment
- Tests go in `_test.go` files in the same package
- No external dependencies without discussion — mcpx stays lightweight

### What We're Looking For

Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned work. High-impact areas:

- **Transport support**: SSE, WebSocket, stdio proxying
- **Security**: OAuth 2.1, JWT validation, mTLS
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
- **Tests**: Integration tests, edge cases, error paths
- **Documentation**: Architecture docs, usage examples, tutorials
